player CreateDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Base Radio","There is a green Land Rover with lots of antennae at Base with a high power radio inside. This will always be next to the main ammo box. You can access the radio by ace interacting while inside, then going to racks and selecting the option to 'USE' the VRC-103, then using the radio as you would use a secondary radio.
<br /><br />
You can also access this from outside the vehicle up to 10 meters away, but you need to get in the vehicle first to enable the option.

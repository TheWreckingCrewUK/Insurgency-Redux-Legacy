You can find out the locations of these by questioning civilians in the towns, where you will get map markers with intel. An orange marker is a cache, a green marker is a stronghold, a blue marker is a situation and a yellow marker is an IED. Dealing with these on your travels is a very efficient method of getting points to complete the AO. You can view your current points by looking at the mission status section on your ACE self interaction menu."]];
